{"name":"Ogar-plus","tagline":"A modified copy of Ogar","body":"# Ogar-Plus\r\n\r\nBuild Status : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus)\r\n\r\nCopy of ogar that I heavily modified, and will continue to update. The [OgarProject](https://ogarproject.com) owns Ogar, and I do not claim it as mine! Original Ogar found [here](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## We working on\r\n##### WORKING\r\n\r\n\r\n* NOTHING...\r\n\r\n\r\n##### SOON\r\n\r\n\r\n* More Gamemode...\r\n\r\n\r\n## Slow Progression\r\nI don't have that much time for this project anymore unfortunately. I will still update occasionally, but the rest will be from Porama. He is not required to update, but can when he chooses. In my opinion, Ogar is semi-broken until Ogar 2.\r\n#### Problems/Glitches that I have found:\r\n* Have to be bigger than your pieces to merge\r\n* Small food eats players on occasion\r\n* Switching gamemodes is poorly coded\r\n* Splitting mechanics are cheap\r\n* Bot pathing = Headless Chicken\r\n\r\nI know this project is made by a small team and such, but the development has come to almost a complete stop since Ogar 2's announcement. I would fix the problems myself, as this is a modified copy, but as mentioned before I don't have much time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ogar-Plus Binary Download\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [Ogar-Plus - Windows](https://github.com/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus/blob/master/binary/OgarPlus.exe?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ogar-Plus Remote\r\n#### [Ogar-Plus Remote - Windows](https://github.com/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus-GUI/blob/master/Ogar-Plus%20GUI/bin/Release/Ogar-Plus%20GUI.exe?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Control your Ogar-Plus server remotely\r\n* You will need port 556 to be open\r\n* Need .NET Framework 4.5.2 or newer to use\r\n* Now available only on Windows\r\n* [Click me to see how to use it](https://github.com/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus/wiki/How-to-use-'OgarPlus-Remote')\r\n\r\n## Obtaining and Using\r\nInstall [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (the ws modules are now included with Ogar-Plus). Only use this version if you want to use the source. (for editing and modifying ogar to your liking) If you don't have Node.js, The server will NOT run!\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n* Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)\r\n* Open Start.bat in /src\r\n* If you're running on port 443, make sure Skype is closed, otherwise choose another port by changing gameserver.ini.\r\n* Go to your defaultgateway and forward your port to your local IP. (in Windows open CMD and type: ipconfig and look for IPv4 address)\r\n* Locally connect by http://agar.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:yourport or by typing the JavaScript command: connect(\"ws://127.0.0.1:yourport\")\r\n* Others outside your network will have to connect with your external IP. They will use the same port, but ip found [here](http://cmyip.com/)\r\n\r\nLinux Manual:\r\n```sh\r\n~$ git clone git://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar.git Ogar\r\n~$ npm install ws\r\n~$ node Ogar\r\n```\r\nUsing the Linux install script:\r\n```sh\r\n~$ sudo ogar-linux-script.sh install /your/preferred/directory\r\n~$ sudo -u ogar -H /bin/sh -c \"cd; /bin/node src/index.js\"\r\n```\r\nUsing ```sudo -u ogar -H /bin/sh -c \"cd; /bin/node src/index.js\" ``` to launch the server increases security by running the process as an unprivileged, dedicated user with a limited shell and it is recommended to do so.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ogar-Plus listens on the following addresses and ports:\r\n* *:88 - for the stats server\r\n* *:443 - for the game server\r\n* *:556 - for the GUI server\r\n\r\nPlease note that on some systems, you may have to run the process as root or otherwise elevate your privileges to allow the process to listen on the needed ports. **If you are getting an EADDRINUSE error, it means that the port required to run Ogar is being used. Usually, Skype is the culprit. To solve this, either close out skype, or change the serverPort value in gameserver.ini to a different port. You will have to change your connection ip to \"127.0.0.1:PORT\"**\r\n\r\nOnce the game server is running, you can connect (locally) by typing `agar.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:PORT` into your browser's address bar, or javascript:connect(\"ws://IP:PORT\",\"\") if you have issues or want the old system back.\r\n\r\n## Configuring Ogar\r\nUse \"gameserver.ini\" to modify configurations.\r\n\r\n## Custom Game modes\r\nOgar-Plus has support for custom gamemodes. To switch between game modes, change the value of \"serverGamemode\" in the configurations file to the selected game mode id and restart the server. There is a guide in the Gamemodes folder that teaches you how to make them. The current gamemodes are:\r\nGAMEMODES\r\n\r\nId   | Name\r\n-----|--------------\r\n0    | Free For All\r\n1    | Teams\r\n2    | Experimental\r\n3    | Virus Off\r\n10   | Tournament\r\n11   | Hunger Games\r\n12   | Zombie Mode\r\n13   | Team Z\r\n14   | Team X\r\n15   | FFA Time Limited (BETA)\r\n16   | Leap\r\n17   | ?\r\n18   | Murder (BETA)\r\n20   | Rainbow FFA\r\n21   | Debug\r\n\r\n## Console Commands\r\nThe current available console commands are listed here. Command names are not case sensitive, but player names are.\r\n\r\n - Addbot [Number]\r\n   * Adds [Number] of bots to the server. If an amount is not specified, 1 bot will be added.\r\n - Board [String 1] [String 2] [String 3] ...\r\n   * Replaces the text on the leaderboard with the string text.\r\n - Boardreset\r\n   * Resets the leaderboard to display the proper data for the current gamemode\r\n - Change [Config setting] [Value]\r\n   * Changes a config setting to a value. Ex. \"change serverMaxConnections 32\" will change the variable serverMaxConnections to 32. Note that some config values (Like serverGamemode) are parsed before the server starts so changing them mid game will have no effect.\r\n - Clear\r\n   * Clears the console output\r\n - Color [Player ID] [Red] [Green] [Blue]\r\n   * Replaces the color of the specified player with this color.\r\n - Food [X position] [Y position] [Mass]\r\n   * Spawns a food cell at those coordinates. If a mass value is not specified, then the server will default to \"foodStartMass\" in the config.\r\n - Gamemode [Id]\r\n   * Changes the gamemode of the server. Warning - This can cause problems.\r\n - Kick [Player ID]\r\n   * Kicks the specified player or bot from the server.\r\n - Kill [Player ID]\r\n   * Kills all cells belonging to the specified player.\r\n - Killall\r\n   * Kills all player cells on the map.\r\n - Mass [Player ID] [Number]\r\n   * Sets the mass of all cells belonging to the specified player to [Number].\r\n - Merge [Player ID]\r\n   * Forces the specified player to merge.\r\n - Name [Player ID] [New Name]\r\n   * Changes the name of the player with the specified id with [New Name].\r\n - Playerlist\r\n   * Shows a list of connected players, their IP, player ID, the amount of cells they have, total mass, and their position. \r\n - Pause\r\n   * Pauses/Unpauses the game.\r\n - Ping\r\n   * Pings you server\r\n - Reload\r\n   * Reloads the config file used by the server. However, the following values are not affected: serverPort, serverGamemode, serverBots, serverStatsPort, serverStatsUpdate.\r\n - Status\r\n   * Shows the amount of players currently connected, time elapsed, memory usage (memory used/memory allocated), and the current gamemode.\r\n - Stop\r\n   * Stops the server and displays bye message\r\n - Tp [Player ID] [X position] [Y position]\r\n   * Teleports the specified player to the specified coordinates.\r\n - Virus [X position] [Y position] [Mass]\r\n   * Spawns a virus cell at those coordinates. If a mass value is not specified, then the server will default to \"virusStartMass\" in the config.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nPlease see [this link](https://github.com/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
