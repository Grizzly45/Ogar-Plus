# Ogar-Plus

Build Status : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OgarPlus/Ogar-Plus)

Copy of ogar that I heavily modified, and will continue to update. The [OgarProject](https://ogarproject.com) owns Ogar, and I do not claim it as mine! Original Ogar found [here](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar)

## Obtaining and Using
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (the ws modules are now included with Ogar-Plus). Only use this version if you want to use the source. (for editing and modifying ogar to your liking) If you don't have Node.js, The server will NOT run!

Windows:
* Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)
* Open Start.bat in /src
* If you're running on port 443, make sure Skype is closed, otherwise choose another port by changing gameserver.ini.
* Go to your defaultgateway and forward your port to your local IP. (in Windows open CMD and type: ipconfig and look for IPv4 address)
* Locally connect by http://agar.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:yourport or by typing the JavaScript command: connect("ws://127.0.0.1:yourport")
* Others outside your network will have to connect with your external IP. They will use the same port, but ip found [here](http://cmyip.com/)

Linux Manual:
```sh
~$ git clone git://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar.git Ogar
~$ npm install ws
~$ node Ogar
```
Using the Linux install script:
```sh
~$ sudo ogar-linux-script.sh install /your/preferred/directory
~$ sudo -u ogar -H /bin/sh -c "cd; /bin/node src/index.js"
```
Using ```sudo -u ogar -H /bin/sh -c "cd; /bin/node src/index.js" ``` to launch the server increases security by running the process as an unprivileged, dedicated user with a limited shell and it is recommended to do so.

Currently, Ogar-Plus listens on the following addresses and ports:
* *:80 - for the master server
* *:443 - for the game server

Please note that on some systems, you may have to run the process as root or otherwise elevate your privileges to allow the process to listen on the needed ports. **If you are getting an EADDRINUSE error, it means that the port required to run Ogar is being used. Usually, Skype is the culprit. To solve this, either close out skype, or change the serverPort value in gameserver.ini to a different port. You will have to change your connection ip to "127.0.0.1:PORT"**

Once the game server is running, you can connect (locally) by typing `agar.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:PORT` into your browser's address bar, or javascript:connect("ws://IP:PORT","") if you have issues or want the old system back.

## Configuring Ogar
Use "gameserver.ini" to modify configurations.

## Custom Game modes
Ogar-Plus has support for custom gamemodes. To switch between game modes, change the value of "serverGamemode" in the configurations file to the selected game mode id and restart the server. There is a guide in the Gamemodes folder that teaches you how to make them. The current gamemodes are:
GAMEMODES

Id   | Name
-----|--------------
0    | Free For All
1    | Teams
2    | Experimental
3    | Virus Off
10   | Tournament
11   | Hunger Games
12   | Zombie Mode
13   | Team Z
14   | Team X
20   | Rainbow FFA
21   | Debug

## Console Commands
